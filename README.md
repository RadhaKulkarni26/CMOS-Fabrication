# CMOS Fabrication
### CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) fabrication is the process of manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) using complementary pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) on a semiconductor substrate. The fabrication process involves a series of steps, including creating well regions, growing oxide layers, depositing and patterning polysilicon, implanting source and drain regions, and depositing and patterning metal layers for interconnects.
